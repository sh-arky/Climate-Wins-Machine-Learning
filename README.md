### **Info**

This is a repository of work for a project interested in predicting climate change through weather patters using a variety of Machine Learning techniques.

I utilized data from the European Climate Assessment and Data Set project. The main data set can be downloaded [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/da-spec-ml/Scripts/A1/Dataset-weather-prediction-dataset-processed.csv).

### **Tools and Techniques**

The analysis for this project was conducted in Python Jupyter and MS Excel. Python Libraries used include:

Pandas 

Numpy

seaborn

Matplotlib

mpl_toolkits

sklearn

Visualizations were created in Python. 

### **Various Machine Learning algorithms were implemented to conduct modeling and assess fitness of models to predicting the data.**

Some of these algorithms include:

K-Nearest Neighbor

Decision Tree

Artificial Neural Networks

### **I backed all of these algorithms with Confusion Matrix evaluations. The results can be found in the repository.**
